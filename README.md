# Summary

This is my first attempt at a portfolio site after the Web Foundations course. Since this project is essentially for my eyes only I want this README to be an overview of my process.

** Step 1 **
I sketched all the parts of the site on a paper

** Step 2 **
I decided to apply styles to the DIVS to test how they fall along the site. So I'm aiming to set up the layout first and the media queries before I add actual content.
